*Welcome, Agent. You’ve arrived at my Base of Operations* — a digital HQ for data dumps, shifting obsessions, and the occasional rant. I’m Cory, an IT specialist by trade. This blog is my sandbox — a place to lock in what I’m learning, and to write about the things I’m passionate about. It’s also a bit of a time capsule — something my family can look back on someday and see what made me tick.

### 🛠️ What you'll probably find here:

- IT Guides/Knowledge & Career Advice
- Gaming Stuff
- Hot Takes on UFC/WWE
- Book Reviews (When I actually finish them)
- Personal Stuff...maybe

Right now, I’m diving deep into computer networking as I'm working towards becoming a network engineer. I’ll be sharing some in-depth breakdowns of the concepts I’m learning soon — both to reinforce my understanding and maybe help someone else along the way.

I’ve built this site with Hugo. For now, I’m deploying it using GitHub Pages, but I’ll soon be spinning up a virtual private server, and maybe even setting up my own email server.

It just occurred to me—you probably have no idea what "RapidF5" means. On a standard American keyboard, F5 is the refresh key, so "RapidF5" basically means rapid refresh. I thought it was a clever name for a healer when I was trying to come up with a gamertag. I used to play Moira a lot in Overwatch, who’s a healer, and I also like playing healer roles in The Division. I even tried being a healer in Diablo 4, but that didn’t really work out—the game felt way too repetitive for me. Funny enough, that’s coming from someone who loves The Division, where you run the same missions over and over for better loot.

### Anyway, thanks for stopping by!
